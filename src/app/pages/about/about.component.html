        <p>
          Steph Loughman is an author of fictional books based on real life. She is also happily married with eight children and
          seven grandchildren. They live in central Ohio, but dream of one day living in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
          Although her books are fictional, she writes most of her books from some personal aspect. In her first book, The
          Journey, Steph uses her own personal pain to tell the story of little Joshua, who died of an abortion when she was
          seventeen weeks pregnant. Through an emotional journey between Heaven and Earth, Joshua and his mommy find each other in
          a dream when she experiences forgiveness and healing. The second of Steph’s published work is a Bible study companion to
          The Journey.

        </p>
        <p>Steph’s newest project is a novel series where Joshua is joined with two of his siblings (who passed away as a result of
        miscarriages) and their uncle Robb (Steph’s brother who died in 2004) as they go on a cross-country adventure after the
        death of their parents. Turning her pain into beauty, Steph gives life once again to these precious souls in her books.
        Book one of this series will be release early summer 2021.
        Steph loves telling her story showing the amazing grace of God through the hardships of life and is always open to
        speaking engagements of any size.</p>
