Not only that, but she is able to tie in a biblical aspect which helps to dive into the feelings she as a mother is having. Moving, touching and all around beautiful. Definitely give this a read if you are struggling with the guilt and depression of having an abortion, I believe it will help give you peace.`

The first half of the book is written from the baby’s perspective and the second half from the authors perspective. She tells of the experiences that shaped her, her life through young adulthood and the place she found herself in that ultimately brought her to the decision to have an abortion.
This story will help anyone who’s had an abortion to understand that they can experience healing and don’t have to carry guilt and shame for their choices.
A moving and inspiring account of a taboo subject.`

Ms. Loughman offers a path to healing for women grieving their losses, whether through abortion or miscarriage.
